# Recognizer Diagram Sketch (RecorDS)

Drafting whiteboard diagrams is a common job for professionals working with software development, as it allows team members to collaborate simultaneously, having the advantages of simplicity and convenience of use. On the other hand, there are problems with documentation maintenance and future rework to reconstruct the sketched models. In view of this, a tool was developed that enables the recognition of class diagrams. However, the system requires the installation of a second application to work, in addition to being limited to the exclusive recognition of classes, associations and multiplicities. Therefore, the objective of our work is to carry out a technological update and solve some existing limitations. To achieve this goal, we updated the state of the art on the recognition of sketches of UML diagrams, we also identified possible improvements in the developed version, and finally we evaluated the tool. Thus, this work contributes to the reengineering of the project, which attributed modularity and scalability to the project. As well as the implementation of a solution, to add generalization recognition.
